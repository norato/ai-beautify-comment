## üîí Security & Privacy

Your privacy is paramount:

- **API Key Storage:** Your Google Gemini API key is stored exclusively on your local machine using the secure `chrome.storage.local` API.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** You must unzip the extension files into a folder where they will **permanently reside**. Do not use your `Downloads` folder. If you move or delete the folder, Chrome will remove the extension.

### Step 2: Enable Developer Mode in Chrome

2. In the top-right corner, toggle **"Developer mode"** ON
3. You'll see additional buttons appear

2. Navigate to and select the folder where you extracted the extension files
3. The extension should now appear in your extensions list and toolbar

## ‚ö° Developer Mode Limitations

**Important Note:** Because this extension is not distributed through the Chrome Web Store, Chrome will show you a **"Disable developer mode extensions"** popup each time you restart the browser.

**You must click "Cancel" (or the "X") to keep the extension running.** Clicking "Disable" will turn the extension off. This is a security feature of Chrome and is unavoidable for extensions loaded this way.
